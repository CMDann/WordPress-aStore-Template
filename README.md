WordPress-aStore-Template
=========================

This is a PHP WordPress page template that allows you to embed an aStore directly into your WordPress website. An aStore is an Amazon affiliate store that you can creat to sell products through your affiliate program.

This page will load your aStore and skip the sidebar to allow for proper integration. 

Known Issues
============

Because the aStore is only available for desktop website and not mobile, this is not optimized for mobile. You can not edit the iframe using CSS. Some product reviews may also be cut off if the page is streched too much. This is of course a problem with the embeded store.
